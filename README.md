# dontATmega32A
A hobby project to emulate the behaviour of the ATmega32A microcontroller using Verilog HDL.

The name of the project is meant to be a play on the Internet slang ["don't @me"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/don%27t_@_me). I am not currently a professional FPGA dev, so I'll be the first to admit the possibility for there being errors or "gotchas". 

If you use my ATmega32A in place of a _**real**_ ATmega32A... don't @me. ðŸ˜œ
